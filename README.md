# 4-variations-of-QUICKSORT-implementation-and-performance-comparison

This is the first assessed exercise (out of two) of ADSE2 course in term 2 of year 2 in
Bsc Computing Science degree in the University of Glasgow that I have submitted on Friday 11th February, 2022.

As can be seen in the pdf file called "AE1 -ADSE2 (originally provided)",
this assessed exercise is about:

1. Implementing four variants of the quicksort algorithm in Java, which are:

    - QUICKSORT with PARTITION implementing the right-most element pivot selection;
    - A variant of QUICKSORT which returns without sorting subarrays with fewer than k elements
      and then uses INSERTION-SORT to sort the entire nearly-sorted array;
    - A variant of QUICKSORT using the median-of-three partitioning scheme; and
    - 3-WAY-QUICKSORT.
